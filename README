a2x is a light C framework I wrote to help me write my software faster and
easier. It currently supports desktop Linux, GP2X F-100/200, and GP2X Wiz.

a2x is in its early stages, and while being useful, it isn't documented at the
time of this writing (17 Feb 2010) and certain parts of it are outdated or
unpolished.

I will continue to work on it in parallel with programs that use it, and will
add documentation to the project's wiki.
